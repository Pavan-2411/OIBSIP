            “Oh my goodness, I’ve heard this question before. Yeah, I’m gonna give it an honest answer again. I thought he (Virat) was quite cocky and arrogant when I met him first. A hairstyle going, absolutely flamboyant. But the minutes I got to know him better and watched him play,I had a lot of respect for him, ” ABD replied to Chris Gayle during their chat session.

                Chris Gayle opened up on what he missed about RCB, stating, “What I miss most about RCB is the team’s environment. It was a fantastic environment and no matter what, we lost or we won, we were always together. We were always sitting together, whether it’s in a room or at an after party. I miss that camaraderie. It’s fantastic how we built that bond, it was absolutely superb.”</p>
